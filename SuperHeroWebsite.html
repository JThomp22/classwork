Information about my Superhero-ness:
<title>My SuperHero Website</title>
</h1>
Hi! I'm a SuperHero. I go by the Guy-Dressed-In-Blue-And-Red-Guy-Because-Superman-Is-Copyrighted! Or for short: "GDIBARGBSIC." I became a superhero by my amazing genes. Basically a mutation caused me to have the same powers as Superman and look almost identical to him! The powers include eye-beams, super-strength, and pretty much anything else Superman can do, I can most likely do the same. For more information see the link below.
